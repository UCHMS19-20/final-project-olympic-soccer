Welcome to my game: Olympic Soccer!
This is a two-player game, but there is nothing stopping you from playing against yourself.
In order to start the game, all you need to do is run the code.
When the game starts, the character in the upper half of the screen is Poseidon and the character in the lower half is Zeus. Poseidon is controlled with WASD, while Zeus is controlled with the arrow keys.
The objective of the game is to put the ball in the goal. The game is very similar to ice hockey, as the ball bounces off the boundaries instead of going out of bounds. Use the boundaries to your advantage!
The first player to 10 goals wins and even gets to hear a few words from their Greek god.
Enjoy!
